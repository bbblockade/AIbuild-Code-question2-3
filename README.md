# 🧩 Coding Test – Category Tree (Question 2 & Question 3)

This project contains both a backend and a frontend for handling and displaying nested category data.

- ✅ **Question 2**: Builds a category tree from a flat list and serves it via an API using Node.js and Express.
- ✅ **Question 3**: Displays the category tree using a React frontend, allowing the user to select a single category using Ant Design’s `TreeSelect`, with state management via Redux.
